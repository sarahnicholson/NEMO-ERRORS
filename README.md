NEMO-ERRORS
===========

Documenting ERRORS when running NEMO and PISCES
------------------------------------------------------------------

This page has been setup with the primary aim of acting as an error-solution output/forum for model users of the NEMO (Nucleus for European Modelling of the Ocean) and PISCES  ("Pelagic Iteraction Scheme for Carbon and Ecosystem Studies") 
modelling systems. The benefit is to help each other to handle typical errors quickly. 

Please contribute by documenting all your errors along with their solutions. 

Your errors could either be "general errors" which are associated with running of NEMO/PISCES itself or "user configuration errors" which relate to a specific configuration. 

There are two .md files associated with this page: _NEMO-ERROR_ logbook and _PISCES-ERROR_ logbook within are various headers for example: time-stepping errors etc. 
To make it easy to search through the error logbooks please maintain this type of approach when you add an error.

Thank you,
